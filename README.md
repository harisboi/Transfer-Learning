## What we did in general

Used PyTorch to classify an image using a pre-trained AlexNet model. We first imported the necessary libraries, including PyTorch, torchvision, and Pillow. We then defined a series of image transformations to preprocess the input image, including resizing, center cropping, converting to a tensor, and normalizing.

Next, we downloaded an example image and the ImageNet class labels text file. We then opened the example image and applied the defined transformations to it. We then added an extra dimension to the image tensor to create a batch.

Next, we loaded the AlexNet model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and set it to evaluation mode. We then performed forward pass to get the model's output.

Finally, we loaded the class labels from the text file, sorted the output, and calculated class probabilities. We then printed the top 5 predicted classes and their probabilities.

## Conclusion

Demonstrated how to use PyTorch to classify an image using a pre-trained model. We can use this approach to classify images for a variety of tasks, such as object detection, image recognition, and image segmentation.
